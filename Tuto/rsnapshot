Main purpose of Rsnapshot is to offer granular backup of your data over a nas

Here we foreseen this backups for the folder /home/pi over a nas to keep all our configuration and also moonraker db to retain Voron usage over reinstallation of the raspberry (because, you know, shit happens TM Murphy)

1: pre requisites
SSH access to the pi
NAS up and running
SMB share availlable on the NAs (not part of this guide but i recommend a separate folder and user, i use rpibackup user that access /mnt/backups/rpi)


2: Auto mount the NAS share:
sudo apt-get install cifs-utils

Create a password file:
nano /home/pi/.smb


user=backuprpi
password=MyPassword

then edit fstab 
sudo nano /etc/fstab 
and add the following line
#remote path.                       local path  sharetype  options
//MonServer.ip(ou name)/BackupShare /mnt/backup cifs  uid=0,credentials=/home/pi/.smb,iocharset=utf8,vers=3.0,noperm 0 0

then test the mount using 
sudo mount -a

Now we have a nas share availlable on a folder on the pi each boot 

3: installation of rsnashots :
sudo apt-get install rsnapshot 
once installed edit the config file :
sudo nano /etc/rsnapshot.conf 
 
 Change the path to the local one :
# All snapshots will be stored under this root directory.
#
snapshot_root   /mnt/backup/rpi

Choose how many retains :
#########################################
#     BACKUP LEVELS / INTERVALS         #
# Must be unique and in ascending order #
# e.g. alpha, beta, gamma, etc.         #
#########################################

retain  alpha   6
retain  beta    7
retain  gamma   4
#retain delta   3

Here I retain 6 days (alpha) 7 weeks (beta) 4 years (gama)

and lastly ###############################
### BACKUP POINTS / SCRIPTS ###
###############################

# LOCALHOST
backup  /home/pi        localhost/

will tell which folder needs to be saved

 
and validate config using rsnapshot configtest
 
Check what will happen with rsnapshot -t alpha

4:Automation using crontab
Sudo crontab -e
#0 3 * * * /mnt/backup/system_backup.sh
00 09 * * *     /usr/bin/rsnapshot alpha
00 12 * * 7     /usr/bin/rsnapshot beta
00 14 1 * *     /usr/bin/rsnapshot gamma
#00 22 1 * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot delta

use https://crontab.guru to choose your schedule here i have :
one daily at 09 am (alpha 6 retained)
one weekly synday at 12h 7 retains
one monthly first day of month at 1 o clock 4 retained

5: validation 

Check your backups ;) also this could run when the pi is printing (did not see any impact) while i choose to pick up schedule where i m not printing that much so feel fre to change this according to your habits
