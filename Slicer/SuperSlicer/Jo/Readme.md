Some of my profiles exported here either for backups or to share with others.

Please note that those are heavily tunes for my printer and could not work on yours, review all settings and adjust to your configuration

My profiles use Firmware retraction and this need to be enabled in your pinter.cfg with a default value, please have a look to my printer.cfg file

I will not take any responsability over damaged PEI :D

Settings to use :

With PIFvx settings bundle I print with the following:
Print Settings : 0.2mm 0.4nozzle PIF (the HiAccel one require input shapper and will not get good result currently at 5 k accel)
Filament Settings : (KVP ABS) 

For non pif part (no need of 4 perims and 40%+ infill) i use 0.2mm 0.4nozzle V3 (the hiaccel one require input shapper and is not yet optimised)

Enjoy or not,
